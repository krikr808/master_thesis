The method chosen to simulate water waves in realtime, which was the \FVM on an \octree datastructure together with the \VOF, proved to be quite advanced and difficult to implemented properly within the time assigned for \thismasterthesiswork, which was \masterthesisworktime. As for the speed, it is not possible to 

For realtime simulation of surface waves in large bodies of water, where non-linear phenomena are not of any significant importance, the best method to use, considering both implementation time and simulation quality, is probably spectral methods.

\subsection{Difficulties and drawbacks with the method}

Difficulties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dynamical creation/termination of surface cells and determination of properties in new cells
    \item High Courant numbers
    \item High speeds of sound (remedied in \textit{\href{http://physbam.stanford.edu/~kwatra/papers/compressible_semi_implicit/compressible_semi_implicit.pdf}{A method for avoiding the acoustic time step restriction in compressible flow}})
    \item Keeping a sharp interface
    \item Making it work in realtime
\end{itemize}

\section{Already existing software}
