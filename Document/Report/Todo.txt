* Reference section about BFECC
    
    Results are the product of measuring the dependent variable in an experiment.
    Results should be measurable.
    Results should be quantitative whenever possible.
    Results should be fact-based, not opinion based.
    Results are often things such as distances, heights, lengths, weights, # of times, etc.
    In a result section of a lab report NO OPINIONS regarding the results themselves are offered
    (Don’t try to explain why something happened or what it means).

    The first thing conclusions should do is evaluate the hypothesis.
    Conclusions are based directly on experiment results.
    Conclusions attempt to explain the occurrence and/or significance of the results.
    Conclusions may contain opinions that ARE SUPPORTED by the results.
    Conclusions often offer ideas for further testing or study.

    Own conclusion about results vs. conclusions: Results are often in perfect while conclusions are in presence?

    "The average height of a basketball bounce was 24.3 cm" is a result.
    "People chose Pepsi as the pop they liked best 32 times" is a result.
    "Adding Olive Oil to plants is a bad idea if you want them to live" is a conclusion.
    "Julianne is a space cadet" is a conclusion.
    "Julianne day-dreamed 10 times during science class" is a result.
    "Domenickrushed for 75 yards in the football game" is a result.
    "It’s Emma’s world, we’re all just living in it" is a conclusion.
    "Kyle turned in his homework!" is a result.
    "Something must be wrong with Kyle" is a conclusion.
    "Maddiegot an A+ on her science test" is a result.
    "Maddieis a good science student" is a conclusion.
    "Twinkie Milkshakes would be a big seller" is a conclusion.
    "Twinkie Milkshakes got more votes than regular milkshakes" is a result.

    Furthermore, a discussion section is very much like the conclusion section.
    The conclusion section can be said to be a summary of the discussion, it's the ultimate take-away message.
    Therefore, the impprovements and the requirements for the future sections can be parts of the discussion.
    However, they don't have to be included in the conclusion if they are not that important for the reader to take away.

Quite important
---------------

* Explain in document AND add to abstract: A method for using CBC (Convective boundedness criterion) advection schemes for incompressible flows even for uncompressible flows. Motivation: Keep alpha = 1 on an exact level (discuss the different between alpha = 0 and alpha = 1 when it comes to keeping the level exact if alpha is treated as a conservative field (or extensive property), since the level alpha = 0 will be kept but not alpha = 1, the reason for this, and the modification that makes the level alpha = 1 behave as the level alpha = 0)
* Alternative approaches: Using LS method or CLSVOF method instead, using existing software (either free or proprietary, see above), or using a completely different approach like spectral methods (spectral methods would probably be the best way for anyone doing the same thing as I do)
* TikZ plots of simulation. These plots should show: Smearing of alpha; the effect of Hyper-C when it succeeds; vacuum created in the air region that freezes the simulation and eventually eats it up.

May be important
----------------

* Own implementations of algorithms and data structures
* HYPER-C
* Image showing the difference between Hyper-C and UPWIND
* Explain that FSM (free surface modelling) (even advection schemes) is a big area of research. Papers that compare various FSM methods:
    "Volume of fluid methods for immiscible-fluid and free-surface flows" (http://capfluidicslit.mme.pdx.edu/reference/Numerics/Gopala_ChemEngJ2008_VOFMethodsFreeSurfaceFlow.pdf) compares four VOF schemes: Flux-corrected transport (FCT), Lagrangian piecewise linear interface construction (Lagrangian PLIC), Compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes (CICSAM) and intergamma scheme.
    "MODELING OF THE WAVE BREAKING WITH CICSAM AND HRIC HIGH-RESOLUTION SCHEMES" (http://proceedings.fyper.com/eccomascfd2006/documents/85.pdf) from 2006 and "Comparison of CICSAM and HRIC high-resolution schemes for interface capturing" (http://warminski.pollub.plwww.ptmts.org.pl/Waclaw-Koron-2-08.pdf) from 2008 are both from the same two authors and compares the CICSAM and the HRIC schemes.
* This report shows that only a thin layer close to the surface needs to be modelet with the LS method: A sharp interface method for incompressible two-phase flows (http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/frey/levelsets/Sussman%20M.,%20A%20Sharp%20interface%20method.pdf)
    

Not very important
------------------

* Is BFECC the MacCormack method?
* Mention ways to calculate a_h
* Change transported to advected?
* Hoctrees
* No random access to neighbor connections or neighbor cells (in the section about neighbor connections, specifically about neighbor lists)
* Marching cubes
* NVD
* Splash and foam
* \vec{r}_{C_i}, as location that specifies the position of $C_i$
* Change indexation method; those of the "Finite Volume Method" chapter do not match those of the VOF section or the Octree section in the appendix. Also weird in the section about the velocity advection.
* Discretize in time -> Discretize temporally
* Include \citep{Tessendorf2004} (game programming gems 4 article) in section about Laplacian pyramids?
* Abbreviate Laplacian Pyramid Decomposition?
* Mention PDE that can be used to update the signed distance function (see http://www.ims.nus.edu.sg/Programs/fluiddynamic/files/Lecture1-basics.pdf, p 56/67)

Other techniques:
* Real-Time Fluid Simulation using Discrete Sine/Cosine Transforms (unconditionally stable)
* Screen Space Meshes (http://www.matthiasmueller.info/publications/screenSpaceMeshes.pdf)


Phrases in need of being indexed
================================

* cell
* cell center
* cell face
* collocated grid (see also staggered grid)
* control volume (see cell)
* divergence theorem (Ostrogradsky's theorem, see also gradient theorem)
* gradient theorem (fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals, see also divergence theorem)
* node
* staggered grid (see also collocated grid)
* surface vector

Topics to cover
===============

* Velocity advection term (in the FVM chapter)

Topict to check up
==================

* Turbulens model (Large Eddy Simulation for example)
* Mention Zalesak’s problem (for advection tests of sharp interfaces)
* The SWAN wave model
* Implicit methods (Like SIMPLE)

Miscellaneous todo's
====================

* Fix TODO's in LaTeX code
* Find out what UPWIND stands for
* Mention that not al children of an octree parent cell have to exist (cross refer from the chapter Octrees to image in appendix)
* Include plots
* Include glossary (see http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary)
* Use frontmatter, mainmatter and backmatter (which are only available for the book class by default)
* Prevent abstract from messing up the page numbering
* Fins some good way to abbreviate long names using code (the abbrevs package in not good for several reasons)
* Hint readers to click on the links in the bibliography (there are a lot of links to free-access pdf files)

...

* Use Piponet's paper as main reference instead of Losasso's? (No.)

Bugs to fix in the report
=========================

* There's a bug in declareacronyms when INDEXACRONYMS is false and the acronym is used on two different pages, index key gets messed up (don't know why)
* For declareacronym and declareacronyms, if USEACRONYMS is false but INDEXACRONYMS is true (which I don't know why anyone would use), the full form doesn't end up in the index
* If an acronym expansion is used as part of an index key, at least with the separated versions of idx, superfluous spaces are inserted before and after the key expanded with an acronym.
