
Sections left to write after importance
---------------------------------------

* Summary of methods used

* Results and conclusions
* Own implementations of algorithms and data structures
* Improvements
* Splash and foam
* NVD
* HYPER-C

Phrases in need of being indexed
--------------------------------

* cell
* cell center
* cell face
* collocated grid (see also staggered grid)
* control volume (see cell)
* divergence theorem (Ostrogradsky's theorem, see also gradient theorem)
* gradient theorem (fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals, see also divergence theorem)
* node
* staggered grid (see also collocated grid)

Topics to cover
---------------

* My modification of CICSAM (or the VOF method)
* Velocity advection term (in the FVM chapter)

Topict to check up
------------------

* Turbulens model (Large Eddy Simulation for example)
* Mention Zalesakâ€™s problem (for advection tests of sharp interfaces)
* The SWAN wave model

Miscellaneous todo's
--------------------

* Find out what UPWIND stands for
* Mention that not al children of an octree parent cell have to exist (cross refer from the chapter Octrees to image in appendix)
* Include plots
* Include glossary (see http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary)
* Use frontmatter, mainmatter and backmatter (which are only available for the book class by default)
* Prevent abstract from messing up the page numbering
* Fins some good way to abbreviate long names using code (the abbrevs package in not good for several reasons)
* Hint readers to click on the links in the bibliography (there are a lot of links to free-access pdf files)

...

* Use Piponet's paper as main reference instead of Losasso's? (No.)

Bugs to fix
-----------

* There's a bug in declareacronyms when INDEXACRONYMS is false and the acronym is used on two different pages, index key gets messed up (don't know why)
* For declareacronym and declareacronyms, if USEACRONYMS is false but INDEXACRONYMS is true (which I don't know why anyone would use), the full form doesn't end up in the index
* If an acronym expansion is used as part of an index key, at least with the separated versions of idx, superfluous spaces are inserted before and after the key expanded with an acronym.
