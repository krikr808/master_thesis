\section{Algebraic advection schemes}

When choosing an \idxs{advection}{scheme}, there are a few things that are important to note. One of those things is that many advection schemes tend to smear out the field that is being transported, which is devastating if the field contains sharp features, such as interfaces between two phases of a flow, that it is important to keep sharp.

A \LUDS, like the \UPWIND scheme, the \CD scheme or the \QUICK scheme, tends to increase the region of the interface. A simple \UPWIND scheme will \idxs{low-pass}{filter} the field that is transported, eventually removing all sharp features present in the field.

Other \LUDSs, like the \CD or \QUICK schemes, will presenve sharp features, but they are on the other hand affected by \idxs{frequency}{dispersion}, thry are \unbounded (there is no limit for how large the field that is being transported can become), and they may even be unstable, especially for large \idxp{time step}{s}.

\subsection{Stability}

When advecting advecting a \idxse{scalar}{field}{scalar} or \idxsp{vector}{field}, it is important that the advection scheme that is used is stable. Unstable advection schemes tend to gradually increase the total \idxe{energy!of a field}{energy}\index{field!energy|see{energy}} of the field, making it go to infinity as the time goes to infinity which causes an explosion.

The \UPWIND scheme is both very simple to implement and unconditionally stable as long as the \CFL conditin is satisfied, and is therefore suitable to use when it is important that the energy of the field that is being transported stays bounded.
