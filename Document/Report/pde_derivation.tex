\chapter{Derivation of twodimensional PDEs for water waves at varying depths}

In this appendix I will present a twodimensional partial differential equation describing the evolution of surface waves for intermediate, mildly varying water depths. It is derived from the dispersion relation used in Airy wave theory, namely:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dispersion}
\omega(k) = \sqrt{g\,k\,\tanh(k\,h)}
\end{equation}

where \(\omega\) is the angular freequency of the wave, 

for monotonic waves on intermediate constant water depth.
