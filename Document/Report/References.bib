	This model is based on a statistical approach and integrates the

	ranges from a 1-m to a kilometer scale. It also takes into account
	submetric variability. A two-scale approach has been applied by superimposing
	small scale variability (smaller than the pixel footprint) to larger
	ones. Introducing multiresolution in the sensor field of view allows
	the requirement of any observational configuration, including nadir
	as well as grazing view geometry. The physical background of the
	methods has been tested against theoretical considerations. We also
	obtained a good agreement with dataset collections at our disposal
	and taken from the literature, such that a bias shows up at grazing
	angles, mainly explained by not taking into account multiple reflections.
	Applied to the generation of synthetic sea surface radiance images,
	our model leads to good quality ocean scenes, whatever the contextual
	conditions.},

  abstract = {{This report presents an approach for efficiently yet precisely simulating
	highly deformable substances ranging from solids to liquids. The
	key idea is to use a state equation for specifying the dynamics of
	the substance. During a simulation, the material is sampled by particles
	that derive their interaction forces from this state equation. Since
	this ensures the same qualitative behavior whatever the discretization
	rate, an adaptive scheme can be used during simulations: the particle
	system adapts over space and time according to a given compromise
	between precision and computati- onal efficiency. The system refines
	(i.e., particles are subdivided) in areas undergoing large or fast
	deformations, while it simplifies (i.e., neighboring particles are
	merged) in stable regions. Meanwhile, the values of the individual
	integration time steps used for each particle are automatica- lly
	adapted to avoid instabilities. An active implicit surface is used
	to visualize the substance. It smoothly coats the particles and filters
	over time internal changes of granularity.}},

  volume = {225},
  pages = {528--553},
  abstract = {An immersed boundary method for computing viscous, subsonic compressible
	flows with complex shaped stationary immersed boundaries is presented.
	The method employs a ghost-cell technique for imposing the boundary
	conditions on the immersed boundaries. The current approach leads
	to a sharp representation of the immersed boundaries, a property
	that is especially useful for flow simulations at high Reynolds numbers.
	Another unique feature of the method is that it can be applied on
	Cartesian as well as generalized body non-conformal curvilinear meshes.
	A mixed second-order central difference-QUICK scheme is used which
	allows a high degree of control over the numerical damping. A bilinear
	interpolation scheme used in conjunction with the ghost-cell approach
	results in second-order global as well as local spatial accuracy.
	The solver is parallelized for distributed memory platforms using
	domain decomposition and message passing interface (MPI) and salient
	features of the parallel algorithm are presented. The accuracy, fidelity
	and efficiency of the solver are examined by simulating flow past
	circular cylinders and airfoils and comparing against experimental
	data and other established results. Finally, we present results from
	a simulation of wing-tip flow at a relatively high Reynolds number
	in order to demonstrate the ability of the solver to model complex,
	non-canonical three-dimensional flows.},

	15$^{\circ}$ equation. The accuracy of the proposed method is increased
	by introducing auxiliary variables, as well as adjusting the parameters
	of the approximation. Poststack migration is carried out by downward
	continuation using the AWWE, for which we have developed a stable,
	explicit, double-marching scheme. Up to 80$^{\circ}$ accuracy is
	achieved by second- order AWWE migration with only 2.3 times the
	com- putational effort of the 15$^{\circ}$ equation and requiring
	almost the same storage. We illustrate the performance of AWWE migration
	using impulse-response graphs, a single-dipping reflector, and a
	slice of the SEG/EAGE salt model.},

  abstract = {Three different speed-up methods (viz., additive multigrid method,
	adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and parallelization) have been combined
	in order to provide a highly efficient parallel solver for the Poisson
	equation. Rather than using an ordinary tree data structure to organize
	the information on the adaptive Cartesian mesh, a modified form of
	the fully threaded tree (FTT) data structure is used. The Hilbert
	space-filling curve (SFC) approach has been adopted for dynamic grid
	partitioning (resulting in a partitioning that is near optimal with
	respect to load balancing on a parallel computational platform).
	Finally, an additive multigrid method (BPX preconditioner), which
	itself is parallelizable to a certain extent, has been used to solve
	the linear equation system arising from the discretization. Our numerical
	experiments show that the proposed parallel AMR algorithm based on
	the FTT data structure, Hilbert SFC for grid partitioning, and additive
	multigrid method is highly efficient.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to describe a coupled pressure based
	solution algorithm to model interface capturing problems for multiphase
	flows where neither of the phases can be regarded as dominant. As
	to a segregated approach using an iterative solution scheme consisting
	of successive solutions of the transport equation for each phase,
	the phase for which the equation is solved first dominates the phases
	for which the transport equations are solved later. This is the result
	of the requirement of a bounded solution for the phase fraction variables.
	A cell which is already completely filled with one phase cannot contain
	any more fluid of any other phase. In the present study, a coupled
	solution approach of the equations to describe the transport of the
	phases and the pressure equation is presented. This coupled approach
	avoids the predescribed numerically induced predominance of a single
	phase which may occur if a common segregated algorithm is used.
	
	
	The system is described by the continuity equation, the equations
	to model the transport of the volume fractions $\alpha_i$ and the
	volumetrically averaged momentum equation. By analogy with the derivation
	of the pressure equation in PISO or SIMPLE, the discretised momentum
	balance is inserted in the equations to describe the transport of
	the $N$ phases. While the volume fractions of $(N - 1)$ phases are
	gained by solving the transport equations, the volume fraction of
	the $N$-th phase is calculated by applying the closure equation.
	
	
	In contrast to segregated approaches, the equations for pressure and
	volume fractions are now solved simultaneously in one single step.
	Therefore the state variables can implicitly depend on other state
	variables. To achieve a strong coupling between the volume fractions
	and the pressure, the pressure is treated implicitly in the equations
	for the volume fractions and the volume fractions are equally treated
	implicitly in the pressure equation. The coupled approach with the
	additional implicit dependencies leads to a matrix which is larger
	and has more non-zero entries than the matrices of a segregated approach.
	Therefore the effort to solve the equation system increases significantly.
	The system is solved applying the block matrix implementation by
	Jasak.},

  abstract = {Realistic water simulation is a challenging domain for the computer
	graphics community. Water-like phenomena can be described quite accurately
	using the Navier-Stokes equations and, thus, convincing simulations
	can be generated. But the computational complexity of this approach
	does not allow interactive frame rates for realistic scenes on today{'}s
	hardware. To achieve real-time performance one has to simplify the
	generality of a Navier-Stokes based simulation in order to lower
	the computational time. A fast and fairly simple 2.5 dimensional
	method can be used for simulate water surfaces. This approach describes
	the water surface as a height-field, which constitutes one of the
	most important limitations of this model. In this thesis an extension
	of the height field model is developed. The layered water model is
	used to overcome to a certain extent the height-field limitation,
	by simulating two interacting water layers. The ultimate goal of
	this extension is the simulation of wave breaking. Chapter one of
	my thesis is an introduction to the water simulation problem and
	gives an overview of the water simulation methods used in the computer
	graphics community. In the next chapter the wave breaking phenomena
	is presented shortly. Upcoming chapters discuss in detail the physical
	model of the layered water simulation. At the end of the thesis results
	are presented and conclusions and further work is discussed. In Appendix
	A a couple of implementation details are presented. iv},

	to a d-dimensional space and have been used to linearize spatially
	distributed data for partitioning, memory management and image processing.
	This paper gives a short introduction to the concept of SFCs and
	highlights some of the applications found in computer science. The
	main focus will be on dynamic distribution and load balancing techniques
	for adaptive grid hierarchies based on SFCs. These methods may be
	used whenever it is necessary to parallelize the solution of partial
	differential equations on a distributed system.},
