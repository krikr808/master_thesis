  month = dec,
  year = {1999},
  abstract = {This report presents an approach for efficiently yet precisely simulating
	highly deformable substances ranging from solids to liquids. The
	key idea is to use a state equation for specifying the dynamics of
	the substance. During a simulation, the material is sampled by particles
	that derive their interaction forces from this state equation. Since
	this ensures the same qualitative behavior whatever the discretization
	rate, an adaptive scheme can be used during simulations: the particle
	system adapts over space and time according to a given compromise
	between precision and computati- onal efficiency. The system refines
	(i.e., particles are subdivided) in areas undergoing large or fast
	deformations, while it simplifies (i.e., neighboring particles are
	merged) in stable regions. Meanwhile, the values of the individual
	integration time steps used for each particle are automatica- lly
	adapted to avoid instabilities. An active implicit surface is used
	to visualize the substance. It smoothly coats the particles and filters
	over time internal changes of granularity.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to describe a coupled pressure based
	solution algorithm to model interface capturing problems for multiphase
	flows where neither of the phases can be regarded as dominant. As
	to a segregated approach using an iterative solution scheme consisting
	of successive solutions of the transport equation for each phase,
	the phase for which the equation is solved first dominates the phases
	for which the transport equations are solved later. This is the result
	of the requirement of a bounded solution for the phase fraction variables.
	A cell which is already completely filled with one phase cannot contain
	any more fluid of any other phase. In the present study, a coupled
	solution approach of the equations to describe the transport of the
	phases and the pressure equation is presented. This coupled approach
	avoids the predescribed numerically induced predominance of a single
	phase which may occur if a common segregated algorithm is used.
	
	
	The system is described by the continuity equation, the equations
	to model the transport of the volume fractions $\alpha_i$ and the
	volumetrically averaged momentum equation. By analogy with the derivation
	of the pressure equation in PISO or SIMPLE, the discretised momentum
	balance is inserted in the equations to describe the transport of
	the $N$ phases. While the volume fractions of $(N - 1)$ phases are
	gained by solving the transport equations, the volume fraction of
	the $N$-th phase is calculated by applying the closure equation.
	
	
	In contrast to segregated approaches, the equations for pressure and
	volume fractions are now solved simultaneously in one single step.
	Therefore the state variables can implicitly depend on other state
	variables. To achieve a strong coupling between the volume fractions
	and the pressure, the pressure is treated implicitly in the equations
	for the volume fractions and the volume fractions are equally treated
	implicitly in the pressure equation. The coupled approach with the
	additional implicit dependencies leads to a matrix which is larger
	and has more non-zero entries than the matrices of a segregated approach.
	Therefore the effort to solve the equation system increases significantly.
	The system is solved applying the block matrix implementation by
	Jasak.},
