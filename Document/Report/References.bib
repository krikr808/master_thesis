  abstract = {Understanding how fluid is modeled for computer graphics can be a
	challenge. This is especially true for students who have not taken
	courses in vector calculus and differential equations, or are rusty
	in these subjects. Beginning students tend to get bogged down in
	the notation of the Navier-Stokes equations and the inevitable difficulties
	that arise when trying to discretize them. Despite this fact, we
	will attempt to show that, given a little instruction, building a
	complete fluid simulator is actually fairly straightforward.},

	the pressure. Complex solid boundaries are represented using a volume-of-fluid

	on regular, statically and dynamically refined grids. The quad/octree
	discretisation proves to be very flexible and allows accurate and
	efficient tracking of flow features. The source code of the method
