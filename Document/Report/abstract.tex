\begin{abstract}
The problem of real-time simulation of ocean surface waves, ship movement and the coupling in between is tackled, and a number of different methods are covered and discussed, of which the finite volume method have been implemented in an attempt to solve the problem, along with the compressible Euler equations, an octree based staggered grid which allows for easy adaptive mesh refinement, the volume of fluid method and a variant of the Hyper-C advection scheme for compressible flows for advection of the phase fraction field.
    
The implementation of the chosen methods proves to be tricky in many ways without earlier experiences in computational fluid dynamics, and involves a large number of topics very advanced only by themselves. Improvements required to make the method sustainable are discussed, and a few suggestions on alternative approaches are given, including a method that is already in use for a very similar purpose.
    
Furthermore, a method for compensating for gain/loss of mass when solving the incompressible flow equations with an inaccurately solved pressure Poison equation is presented and discussed. A momentum conservative method for transporting the velocity field on staggered grids is also presented and implemented. Finally, what are believed to be a new two-dimensional partial differential equation for simulating water surface waves is derived and discussed.
