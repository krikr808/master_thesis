\begin{abstract}
The problem of real-time simulation of ocean surface waves, ship movement and the coupling in between is tackled, and a number of different methods are covered and discussed, of which the finite volume method has been implemented in an attempt to solve the problem, along with the compressible Euler equations, an octree based staggered grid which allows for easy adaptive mesh refinement, the volume of fluid method and a variant of the Hyper-C advection scheme for compressible flows for advection of the phase fraction field.
    
The process of implementing the methods that were chosen proves to be tricky in many ways, and involves a large number of topics that are very advanced only by themselves, and the implementation that was implemented in \thismasterthesiswork suffered from numerous issues, including problems with keeping the interface intact and a harsh restriction on the time-step size due to the CFL condition. Improvements required to make the method sustainable are discussed, and a few suggestions on alternative approaches that are already in use for very similar purposes are also given and discussed.
    
Furthermore, a method for compensating for gain/loss of mass when solving the incompressible flow equations with an inaccurately solved pressure Poison equation is presented and discussed. A momentum conservative method for transporting the velocity field on staggered grids without introducing unnecessary smearing is also presented and implemented. A simple, physically based illumination model for sea surfaces is derived and compared to the Blinn--Phong shading model, although it is never implemented. Finally, a two-dimensional partial differential equation in the spatial domain for simulating water surface waves for mildly varying bottom topography is derived and discussed, although it is deemed to be too slow for real-time purposes and is therefore never implemented.
