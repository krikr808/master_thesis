\chapter{Improvements}

\SIMPLE (although not completely implicit (?))

Use implicit time-stepping

Switch from explicit to implicit methods + use semi-Lagrangian advection to allow arbitrarily large time steps

\section{Visualization}

\subsection{Marching Cubes}

\subsection{Surface shininess}

When \rendering \idxsp{ocean}{scene}{s}, it is not always possible to catch all the fine details in the surface. This is especially true if the \idxs{sea}{state} contains a lot of \energy in the part of the \idxs{wave}{spectrum} where the wavelength is shorter than the shortest \wavelength that can be rendered on the \idxs{computer}{screen} correctly without \folding. When this is the case, those wavelengths have to be removed from the original rendering of the scene in order to avoid getting \idxsp{Moir√©}{pattern}{s} in the rendered image.

%Shading/reflection (increased reflection spreading for increased height = shininess as a function of the part of the spectrum that contains the suppressed high-frequency waves)

%\section{Local-time stepping}

%Very dubious technique as you can make the method allow large time steps. (see below)

\section{Perfectly matched layers}

Avoiding spurious reflections at LOD transitions (Absorbing boundary conditions, Perfectly Matched Layers)

See e.g. \textit{\href{http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:359805/FULLTEXT01}{Memory Efficient Methods for Eulerian Free Surface Fluid Animation}}, which explains explicit dampening, implicit dampening, and wave absorbing boundaries -- the perfectly matched layer approach, and evaluates methods.

\section{Wind waves}

In order to get a realistic \idxs{sea}{state}\index{state of sea|see{sea state}}, it is desirable that the \idxs{water}{surface} \interacts with the \wind in order to give rise to \idxsp{wind}{wave}{s}, so that the sea state is a reflection of the wind speed and direction.

\subsection{Spectral methods}

A very cheap and easy way to simulate wind waves is to use a wind dependent \idxs{wave}{spectrum}, which basically tells how much energy that is stored in each part of the wave spectrum in \average, depending on the \idxs{wind}{velocity}. The wave spectrum $P_h(\vec{k})$ is defined as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:wave_spectrum}
P_{\eta}(\vec{k}) = \left\langle \left|\fdfunc{\eta}(\vec{k})\right|^2 \right\rangle,
\end{equation}

where $\fdfunc{\eta}(\vec{k})$ is the \idxs{Fourier}{transform} of the \idxs{free surface}{elevation} $\eta(\vec{r})$ for the wave vector $\vec{k}$ and the brackets $\langle\rangle$ denotes an \idxs{ensemble}{average}. From that spectrum, a \random sea state is \generated in the \idxs{frequency}{domain}, which is then used to \initialize the simulation. There are different models for describing the wave spectrum for a certain wind velocity, most of which are \empirical. Some of these spectra take into account the wind direction for increased alignment between the surface and the wind, for example the \idxs{Philips}{spectrum} which is used and tweaked in \citep{temp} or the \idxs{Pierson--Moskowitz}{spectrum}.

\subsection{Splash and foam}

In rough weather conditions, 

(See \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_foam}{Wikipedia -- Sea foam}} or search for \textit{protein skimming} or \textit{foam fractionation})

Implemented in \textit{\href{http://nguyendangbinh.org/Proceedings/Eurographics/2003/cgf/volume22/issue3/paper127/paper127.pdf}{Realistic Animation of Fluid with Splash and Foam}}

which references \textit{\href{http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.6262&rep=rep1&type=pdf}{Rendering Natural Waters}}

which in turn is based on work presented in the book \textit{\href{http://books.google.se/books?id=xuwFz1bPTHgC}{Oceanic Whitecaps: Their Role in Air-Sea Exchange Processes}} by E. C. Monahan and G. MacNiocaill.
