The paper analyzes and compares methods for ramification, or for update,
which are based on minimization of change while respecting static domain
constraints. The main results are:
\begin{itemize}
\item An underlying semantics for propagation oriented ramification,
    called \emp{causal propagation semantics}
\item \emp{Comparative assessments} of a number of previously proposed
    entailment methods for ramification, in particular, methods based
    on minimization of change after partitioning of the state variables
    (fluents). This includes the methods previously proposed by del Val
    and Shoham, by Kartha and Lifschitz, and by our group.
\item Assessment of two \emp{ranges of sound applicability} for one
    of those entailment methods, MSCC, relative to causal propagation
    semantics.
\item Identification of an essential feature for minimization-based
    approaches to ramification, namely \emp{changeset-partitioning}.
\end{itemize}
