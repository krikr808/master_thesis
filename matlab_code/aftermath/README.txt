gravity_waves.m is a Matlab script I wrote a while after I had
finished the thesis, to try out a method that uses Fourier transform,
which I realized I should probably have choosen instead. The script
was basically written over a weekend. It is much simpler than the
finite volume method which I implemented in the thesis, but is vastly
superior in speed and quality.
